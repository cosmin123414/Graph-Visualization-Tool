# Graph Visualization Tool
 
This project is a Graph Visualization Tool written in JavaScript, using the vis.js library. It allows you to interactively create and modify a graph, adding and deleting vertices and edges as needed. Additionally, the tool is designed to demonstrate the functionality of various algorithms.

# Project Status
This project is currently under development, with new features and algorithms being added on an ongoing basis. Please check back often for updates.

# Features
The Graph Visualization Tool currently provides the following features:

Add Vertex: Add a new vertex to the graph. This can be done by clicking the 'Add Vertex' button or pressing 'V' on your keyboard.

Add Edge: Add a new edge between two vertices. This can be achieved by clicking the 'Add Edge' button or pressing 'E' on your keyboard. Click on two vertices sequentially to create an edge between them.

Delete: Delete vertices or edges from the graph. This can be done by clicking the 'Delete' button or pressing 'D' on your keyboard, and then clicking on a vertex or an edge.

Recenter: Recenters the graph in the viewing area. This can be accomplished by clicking the 'Recenter' button or pressing 'R' on your keyboard.

Algorithms: Various algorithms can be executed on the graph. As the project is still in development, more algorithms will be added in the future.
